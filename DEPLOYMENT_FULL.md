- ⚠️ Free tier discontinued (paid plans start at $7/month)

## Files Added for Deployment

- `render.yaml` - Render deployment configuration
- `railway.json` - Railway deployment configuration  
- `vercel.json` - Vercel serverless deployment
- `Procfile` - Heroku process file (already existed)
- `runtime.txt` - Python runtime version (already existed)

## Environment Variables

For production deployments, set these environment variables:
- `FLASK_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (usually auto-set by the platform)

## Testing Your Deployment

Once deployed, your app will have full Flask functionality:
- ✅ Working `/api/generate` endpoint
- ✅ Working `/api/examples` endpoint  
- ✅ Real-time configuration generation
- ✅ All backend processing

## GitHub Pages vs Full Deployment

| Feature | GitHub Pages | Full Flask Deployment |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Static files | ✅ | ✅ |
| Backend API | ❌ | ✅ |
| Configuration generation | ❌ | ✅ |
| Free hosting | ✅ | ✅ (with limits) |
| Custom domains | ✅ | ✅ |

## Recommended Deployment Flow

1. **Development**: Run locally with `python app.py`
2. **Staging**: Deploy to Render/Railway for testing
3. **Production**: Use the same platform with custom domain
4. **Showcase**: Keep GitHub Pages for static demo

Your GitHub Pages site serves as a great landing page that links to the full application!
